      "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to model complex patterns in data. It's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, where interconnected neurons process information through multiple levels of abstraction. Deep learning algorithms excel at tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicle navigation. They require large amounts of data and computational power but have achieved remarkable success in various fields, pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.\n",

      "How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning methods?\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep learning differs from traditional machine learning primarily in its ability to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This eliminates the need for manual feature extraction, which is often required in traditional machine learning. Deep learning models, particularly deep neural networks, are composed of multiple layers that can learn increasingly abstract features at each layer. Traditional machine learning methods typically rely on shallow architectures and hand-crafted features, making them less capable of handling unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.\n",
